# EchoMind 🎧🧠  
*An intelligent assistant that listens, understands, and reflects back clearly.*  

---

## 📖 Overview  
**EchoMind** is an end-to-end AI assistant that transforms **spoken input into intelligent, meaningful responses**. It begins with **audio**, transcribes it into text, determines the **intent** behind the query, and routes it to a specialized **OpenAI Agent** designed to handle that type of request.  

Finally, EchoMind generates a **spoken mp3 response**, closing the loop by reflecting back with clarity.  

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
This project demonstrates the ability to:  
- Build **multimodal AI pipelines** (speech → text → intent → agent → speech).  
- Apply **prompt engineering** and **agent specialization** for reliable, context-aware responses.  
- Explore how AI can **enhance accessibility and communication** in everyday life.  

---

## 🧠 Why "EchoMind"?  
- **Echo** → Represents listening, clarity, and reflection.  
- **Mind** → Represents intelligence, understanding, and reasoning.  
Together: *An assistant that doesn’t just hear you — it understands you.*

## 🛠️ Core Features  
- **Voice Input** → Capture natural audio from the user.  
- **Speech-to-Text** → Transcribe spoken words into accurate text.  
- **Intent Classification** → Identify the type of question (e.g., information, scheduling, wellness, knowledge lookup).  
- **Agent Routing** → Specialized OpenAI agents provide domain-specific answers.  
- **AI-Generated Response** → Clear, conversational, human-like responses.  
- **Text-to-Speech** → Deliver responses as **mp3 files** for playback.

## 🚀 Example Flow  
1. User says: *“What’s the weather tomorrow in Chicago?”*  
2. EchoMind transcribes: *“What’s the weather tomorrow in Chicago?”*  
3. The intent classifier routes the request to the **Weather Agent**.  
4. The agent provides the answer.  
5. EchoMind generates: *“Tomorrow in Chicago it will be partly cloudy with a high of 76 degrees.”*  
6. The response is output as an **mp3 file**.  

---

## 🧩 Technology Stack  
- **Python** (core implementation)  
- **OpenAI Whisper API** → Speech-to-Text (STT) transcription.  
- **OpenAI GPT Models** → Natural language understanding, intent classification, and agent responses.  
- **OpenAI TTS API** → Text-to-Speech (mp3 output).  
- **Audio Handling** → Simple Python utilities for mp3 file management.  

---

## 📌 Roadmap  
- [ ] Add multi-turn memory for more natural conversation.  
- [ ] Enable real-time streaming for faster responses.  
- [ ] Expand intent library (knowledge, productivity, wellness, entertainment).  
- [ ] Build a simple **UI layer** (desktop or mobile).  
- [ ] Explore integrations with assistive or wearable technology.

## 🌍 Vision  
Modern AI should do more than just answer questions — it should **listen carefully, understand deeply, and respond clearly**.  

**EchoMind** demonstrates this future:  
> From listening → to understanding → to reflecting back with clarity.
